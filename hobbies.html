                <p class="stage p">In my free time I like to develop my computer skills, 
                    So I started to learn by myself the web languages,
                    html, css, javascript, mysql...
                    I also received courses in python and java during my high school classes, which allowed me to discover many languages during my schooling.
                    I also got familiar with other operating systems like some versions of Linux or even windows.My friends say that i am a creative personn, probably because i like programming or trying new things on my computer when i have some freetime.</p>
            
                <h4 class="title4">football socers</h4>
                <p class="stage p">I have loved football since I was a child, especially the major European and international competitions. I like to play football in my spare time, when time permits, with my friends. As an extrovert, I have no difficulty in talking and working with people I don't know, I consider teamwork as a strength, allowing to develop a group synergy.</p>
            
                <h4 class="title4">sports hall</h4>
                <p class="stage p">During the week I go to the gym, to relax and stay fit. I am motivated and enthusiastic about doing sport. I set goals for myself when I go to the gym and I am able to follow them. So with every session I push myself to my limits  </p>
